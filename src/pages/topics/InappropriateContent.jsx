          You can find almost anything online â€“ from videos about kittens to mature content with violent, hateful, or sexual themes.
          A lot of this mature content is inappropriate for young people under 18. It can be especially disturbing for younger children,
          but even older teens may be bothered if they come across this content unintentionally. It is important to remember that it is
          not your fault if you accidentally come across inappropriate content online. Try to avoid inappropriate content by double checking
          the URLs you type and being careful about clicking on unknown links. In addition to encountering inappropriate content online,
          kids and teens may also share and post inappropriate comments and images. While it is best to refrain from illegal or inappropriate
          actions in the first place, some people have gotten into more trouble by sharing comments or images about them online.
